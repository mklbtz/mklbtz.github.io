  <h3>Web &amp; iOS Developer <small>at</small> <a href="http://cirrusmio.com">CirrusMio, Inc.</a></h3>
  <p class="lead text-muted">May 2014 - present</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Built the iOS app for an enterprise-class, document-storage-and-sync service.</strong> I both designed and implemented the user experience for this application. This was contracted work done for a well-known, local, corporate client.</li>
    <li><strong>Assisted development of enterprise-level CMS using Ruby on Rails.</strong> Following Agile development practices, I helped implement this software for the same client. I used tools like <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>, <a href="https://www.getchef.com">Chef</a>, and <a href="http://theforeman.org">Foreman</a> in addition to Rails.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Web Developer <small>at</small> <a href="http://comm.uky.edu">U.K. Department of Communication</a></h3>
  <p class="lead text-muted">Sept. 2011 - May 2014</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Designed and developed intern-management software using PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap.</strong> Worked with a faculty client to build this system and fill three needs: <strong>1)</strong> Provide students with online applications for the internship program. <strong>2)</strong> Allow the director of the internship program to review and approve new applicants. <strong>3)</strong> Keep records of all students and companies who have been involved in the program since 2009.</li>
    <li><strong>Built several research websites that allowed researchers to systematically analyze data.</strong> Became proficient with MySQL and <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter">Codeigniter</a>—an object-oriented PHP framework which served as the application codebase. These websites were useful because they allowed researchers to work efficiently and think creatively.</li>
    <li><strong>Created dynamic surveys</strong> by integrating PHP, MySQL, and <a href="http://www.filemaker.com">FileMaker</a> with <a href="http://www.qualtrics.com">Qualtrics</a> survey software. These surveys included authentication to the university <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory">Active Directory</a> servers and integration with our faculty and student enrollment databases. These surveys were used for course examinations and faculty ballot boxes, among other things.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>IT Department Intern <small>at</small> <a href="http://alltech.com">Alltech, Inc.</a></h3>
  <p class="lead text-muted">May 2011 - July 2011</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Developed a custom iOS app</strong> for Marketing managers to view sales data. Managers could see weekly and monthly sales figures pulled from XML content on company servers. Because this was Alltech’s first foray into iOS development, I became a helpful resource for my coworkers regarding Apple development.</li>
    <li><strong>Researched and recommended software</strong> which allowed the Legal department to archive case-matter emails to their SharePoint site. The purpose was twofold: to create a permanent storage solution for important emails and to increase productivity by keeping emails in context with related documents. The software was a plug-in for Microsoft Outlook called <a href="http://harmon.ie">Harmon.ie</a>.</li>
  </ul>
