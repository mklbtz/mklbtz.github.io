<h3>Web &amp; iOS Developer at CirrusMio, Inc.</h3>

<p>May 2014 - present</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Team-lead and developer of enterprise content management system in Rails.</strong> I employed Agile-development practices to lead a team of developers through product delivery. I coordinated with our client&#8217;s support team and customers as the product was launched. The app was a one-stop-shop for organizing multimedia content and delivering it to websites and mobile apps.</li>
<li><strong>Built iOS app to facilitate sales pitches and place orders.</strong> I was the lead design consultant and sole engineer. I extensively researched their existing sales workflow.The project was completed in just two months to line up with their next sales initiative.</li>
<li><strong>Built iOS app for enterprise document storage-and-sync service.</strong> I designed and developed the UX for this application from scratch. I also helped develop the complimentary Rails backend.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Web Developer at U.K. Department of Communication</h3>

<p>Sept. 2011 - May 2014</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Designed and developed intern-management PHP app.</strong> Consulted with faculty members and built a system to: <strong>1)</strong> Provide students with online applications for the internship program. <strong>2)</strong> Allow the director of the internship program to review and approve new applicants. <strong>3)</strong> Keep records of all students and companies who have been involved in the program.</li>
<li><strong>Built several research websites that allowed researchers to systematically analyze data.</strong> Became proficient with MySQL and <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter">Codeigniter</a>—an object-oriented PHP framework which served as the application codebase. These websites were useful because they allowed researchers to work efficiently and think creatively.</li>
</ul>
