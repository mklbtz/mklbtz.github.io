## Software Developer at MakeTime, Inc.

- **Developed full-stack solutions** for their CNC machining platform using Ruby on Rails and AngularJS. The platform was responsible for over $1 million in transactions in 2017 and continues to grow.

- Built early version of a **matchmaking microservice** that finds viable candidates from MakeTime's network of over 2000 suppliers. This system ultimately allowed MakeTime to grow with a lean fulfillment team of only four members.

## Software Developer at CirrusMio, Inc.

May 2014 - March 2016

- **Team-lead and developer of enterprise content management system in Rails.** I employed Agile-development practices to lead a team of developers through product delivery. I coordinated with our client's support team and customers as the product was launched. The app was a one-stop-shop for organizing multimedia content and delivering it to websites and mobile apps.
- **Built iOS app to facilitate sales pitches and place orders.** I was the lead design consultant and sole engineer. I extensively researched their existing sales workflow.The project was completed in just two months to line up with their next sales initiative.
- **Built iOS app for enterprise document storage-and-sync service.** I designed and developed the UX for this application from scratch. I also helped develop the complimentary Rails backend.

## Web Developer at U.K. Department of Communication

Sept. 2011 - May 2014

- **Designed and developed intern-management PHP app.** Consulted with faculty members and built a system to: **1)** Provide students with online applications for the internship program. **2)** Allow the director of the internship program to review and approve new applicants. **3)** Keep records of all students and companies who have been involved in the program.
- **Built several research websites that allowed researchers to systematically analyze data.** Became proficient with MySQL and [Codeigniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter)—an object-oriented PHP framework which served as the application codebase. These websites were useful because they allowed researchers to work efficiently and think creatively.

## IT Department Intern at Alltech, Inc.

May 2011 - July 2011

- **Developed a custom iOS app** for Marketing managers to view sales data. Managers could see weekly and monthly sales figures pulled from XML content on company servers. Because this was Alltech’s first foray into iOS development, I became a helpful resource for my coworkers regarding Apple development.
