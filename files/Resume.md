### iOS Platform Engineer at Capital One
*May 2019 - Now*

- **Tech Lead of a six-person engineering team** charged with modernizing our app’s foundations and building a modular system of feature-plugins. After four years of me leading this effort, our app is now fully modernized. 
- **Designed and developed several in-house frameworks** used by hundreds of other developers, including:
	- Reactive, *Redux*-like feature architecture, compatible with UIKit and SwiftUI.
	- Routing algorithm for deep linking to any feature of our modularized app.
	- Dependency injection system inspired by SwiftUI’s `EnvironmentValues`.
- Supported developers as they adopted these new frameworks by writing documentation and providing one-on-one support. I continually refined the design of these libraries in response to feedback and usage patterns.
- **Spearheaded a multi-year migration** from RxSwift to Combine. I designed compiler warnings to progressively guide developers as they migrated their code, which eased the learning curve and my team’s support burden.
- **Built consensus through weekly technical design meetings** with my *Android* counterparts for the sake of cross-platform alignment. 
- **Formally mentored three of my peers**, at their request, to help guide their professional development.
- **Consistently top-ranked** in performance and peer reviews and frequently approached by both developers and product owners for my guidance and knowledge.
