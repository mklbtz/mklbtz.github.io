## Web & iOS Developer at CirrusMio, Inc.

May 2014 - present

- **Team-lead and developer of enterprise content management system in Rails.** I employed Agile-development practices to lead a team of developers through product delivery. I coordinated with our client's support team and customers as the product was launched. The app was a one-stop-shop for organizing multimedia content and delivering it to websites and mobile apps. 
- **Built iOS app to facilitate sales pitches and place orders.** I was the lead design consultant and sole engineer. I extensively researched their existing sales workflow.The project was completed in just two months to line up with their next sales initiative.
- **Built iOS app for enterprise document storage-and-sync service.** I designed and developed the UX for this application from scratch. I also helped develop the complimentary Rails backend. 

## Web Developer at U.K. Department of Communication

Sept. 2011 - May 2014

- **Designed and developed intern-management PHP app.** Consulted with faculty members and built a system to: **1)** Provide students with online applications for the internship program. **2)** Allow the director of the internship program to review and approve new applicants. **3)** Keep records of all students and companies who have been involved in the program.
- **Built several research websites that allowed researchers to systematically analyze data.** Became proficient with MySQL and [Codeigniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter)—an object-oriented PHP framework which served as the application codebase. These websites were useful because they allowed researchers to work efficiently and think creatively.

## IT Department Intern at Alltech, Inc.

May 2011 - July 2011

- **Built iPad app for viewing sales data.** Managers could see weekly and monthly sales figures pulled from XML content on company servers. Because this was Alltech’s first foray into iOS development, I became a helpful resource for my coworkers regarding Apple development.
