## Web Developer at MakeTime, Inc.

March 2016 – Present

- **Developed the MakeTime platform** with a team of twelve people using Ruby on Rails and other open-source technology.
- **Built microservices** that improve the main MakeTime platform without adding bloat to its codebase.
- **Integrated machine-learning algorithms** into MakeTime platform by coordinating with the Data Science division.

## Web & iOS Developer at CirrusMio, Inc.

May 2014 - March 2016

- **Built a prototype sales management iPad app** for a high-profile, local oil company in a matter of months. While this app was never fully integrated into their sales process, the tight feedback loop and clear constraints made this project personally gratifying.
- **Built the iOS app for an enterprise-class, document-storage-and-sync service.** I both designed and implemented the user experience for this application. This was contracted work done for a well-known, local, technology company.
- **Assisted development of enterprise-level CMS using Ruby on Rails.** Following Agile development practices, I helped implement this software for the same client. I used tools like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [Chef](https://www.getchef.com), and [Foreman](http://theforeman.org) in addition to Rails.

## Web Developer at U.K. Department of Communication

Sept. 2011 - May 2014

- **Designed and developed intern-management software using PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap.** Worked with a faculty client to build this system and fill three needs: **1)** Provide students with online applications for the internship program. **2)** Allow the director of the internship program to review and approve new applicants. **3)** Keep records of all students and companies who have been involved in the program since 2009.
- **Built several research websites that allowed researchers to systematically analyze data.** Became proficient with MySQL and [Codeigniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter)—an object-oriented PHP framework which served as the application codebase. These websites were useful because they allowed researchers to work efficiently and think creatively.


## IT Department Intern at Alltech, Inc.

May 2011 - July 2011

- **Developed a custom iOS app** for Marketing managers to view sales data. Managers could see weekly and monthly sales figures pulled from XML content on company servers. Because this was Alltech’s first foray into iOS development, I became a helpful resource for my coworkers regarding Apple development.
