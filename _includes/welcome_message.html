    <p class="lead">Hello!</p >
    <p>
      I am a software developer with experience in delivering Web and iOS apps to enterprise-scale companies. I am a big fan of Swift but I professionally work with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. Functional programming is my current jam. I am familiar with infrastructure technology, including Docker and many AWS tools. Employed by <a href="http://maketime.io">MakeTime</a> in Lexington KY, I am helping build a new on-demand future for the American manufacturing industry.

      I'm no professional designer, but I've got some chops. I obsess over the little details that make software a joy to use. That obsession drives my passion for making memorable user experiences.

      I like to <a href="http://www.lexswingdance.com/">swing dance</a> for fun and exercise. I am also an organizer of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Learn-Swift-Louisville">Learn Swift Louisville</a> meet-up, just one of a <a href="http://www.learnswiftla.com/">larger community of meet-ups</a>.
