    <p class="lead">Hello!</p>
    <p>
      I am a software developer with experience in delivering Web and iOS apps to enterprise-scale companies. 
      I am a big Swift enthusiast, but my day job is working with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and Python. 
      I'm currently expanding my mind with functional programming and category theory. 
      I am familiar with infrastructure technology, including Docker and many AWS tools. 
      I'm no professional designer, but have an eye for good UX. 
      I obsess over the little details that make software a joy to use.

      I like to <a href="https://www.lexswingdance.com/">swing dance</a> for fun and exercise. I am also an organizer of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Learn-Swift-Louisville">Learn Swift Louisville</a> meet-up, part of the larger <a href="https://www.learnswiftla.com/">Learn Swift community</a>. I have also spoken at the <a href="https://www.swiftcloudwork.shop">Swift Cloud Workshop</a>.
