  <h2>Hello!</h2>
  <p>
    I am a developer with experience in Web and iOS development. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from the University of Kentucky in 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently employed by <a href="http://cirrusmio.com">CirrusMio</a>. Located in Lexington, KY, we build better tools for nonprofits.
    While pursuing my degree, I was able to work part-time at <a href="http://www.alltech.com">Alltech</a>, Inc. and the <a href="http://comm.uky.edu">UK Department of Communication</a>. At both positions, I improved my programming and customer support skills.
  </p>
  <p>I am proficient in these languages: Objective-C, Ruby, PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and other C flavors.</p>
  <p>
    I obsess over the little details that make something a joy to use. From that obsession has arisen my passion for making memorable user experiences. I want to make products that people will love and use every day!
  </p>
  <p class="lead">Thanks for stopping by!</p>
