I just gave my first-ever conference talk at [Swift Cloud Workshop](https://swiftcloudwork.shop) #4 and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out! Folks were very encouraging and even said they found the talk inspiring, which is wonderful. Thank you again to the organizers and to everyone who attended. 

The slides are available below. There are many code snippets and links to open source packages, so please check them out. At some point I may turn the talk into a blog-post here as well. ðŸ¤”
